# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Successfully completed Phase 1 of the Options Object Refactoring! This implements the group/context separation architecture while maintaining full backward compatibility.

The refactoring addresses the critical Feature Group resolution issue identified in the options analysis, where Feature Groups were incorrectly splitting based on ALL option differences rather than just isolation-requiring parameters.

## Recent Changes

*   **✅ COMPLETED: Spark Compute Framework Implementation:**


*   **✅ COMPLETED: Phase 1 - Sklearn Pipeline Feature Group Implementation (FINAL):**
    * **File-based Artifact Storage**: Implemented SklearnArtifact with configurable storage paths using joblib
      - Supports both fallback (temp directory) and custom path storage
      - Proper mloda artifact lifecycle integration with `artifact()`, `features.save_artifact`, and `cls.load_artifact()`

    * **Core Implementation**: SklearnPipelineFeatureGroup base class with comprehensive pipeline management
    * **Pandas Support**: PandasSklearnPipelineFeatureGroup with full pandas DataFrame integration
    * **Comprehensive Testing**: 43 test cases covering all functionality (all tests passing)
      - Unit tests for feature parsing, validation, and configuration
      - Integration tests for end-to-end pipeline execution
      - Parametrized tests for storage path scenarios (fallback vs custom paths)
      - Artifact persistence tests verifying save/load functionality
    * **Feature Naming**: `sklearn_pipeline_{pipeline_name}__{source_features}` convention
    * **Pipeline Support**: Multiple sklearn transformers (StandardScaler, SimpleImputer, etc.)
    * **Multi-Feature Support**: Handles comma-separated source features with multiple result columns
    * **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful sklearn import failures and validation
*   **✅ COMPLETED: Iceberg Compute Framework Implementation:**
*   **✅ COMPLETED: DuckDB Framework Documentation Updates:**
*   **✅ COMPLETED: Documentation Updates for Polars Lazy Functionality:**
*   **✅ COMPLETED: Automatic Dependency Detection for Compute Frameworks:**

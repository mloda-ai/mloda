      - Legacy initialization and backward compatibility tests

      - Unique file naming with feature name and configuration hash for artifact isolation
    * **SklearnPipelineFeatureGroup**: Base class for sklearn pipeline feature groups
      - Feature naming convention: `sklearn_pipeline_{pipeline_name}__{source_features}`

## Current Status

The memory bank has been initialized with basic information. Documentation has been improved with README.md files in key directories. A new aggregated feature group pattern has been implemented with both Pandas and PyArrow support, allowing for efficient aggregation operations on different compute frameworks. The TimeWindowFeatureGroup has been implemented to support time-based window operations. The MissingValueFeatureGroup has been implemented to handle missing values in data using various imputation methods. 

The FeatureChainParserConfiguration has been implemented to support configuration-based feature creation, allowing features to be created from options rather than explicit feature names. This enhances the flexibility of the framework and simplifies feature creation in client code. The AggregatedFeatureGroup has been enhanced with this configuration-based approach, and integration tests have been added to demonstrate the functionality.

The TextCleaningFeatureGroup and ClusteringFeatureGroup have been implemented to support text preprocessing and data clustering operations. The GeoDistanceFeatureGroup has been implemented to calculate distances between geographic points using various distance metrics, further expanding the framework's capabilities for geospatial analysis.

The implementation of configurable_feature_chain_parser has been unified across all feature groups, improving consistency and maintainability.

Support for Multiple Result Columns has been added, allowing feature groups to return multiple related columns using a naming convention pattern. This enhances the flexibility of the framework by enabling a single feature computation to produce multiple related outputs.

The ForecastingFeatureGroup has been implemented to support time series forecasting with multiple algorithms and artifact saving/loading capabilities.

The NodeCentralityFeatureGroup has been implemented to calculate various centrality metrics for nodes in a graph, providing insights into the importance and influence of nodes in network data. This feature group supports multiple centrality metrics and both directed and undirected graphs, making it versatile for different types of network analysis tasks.

Comprehensive documentation has been created for feature groups, covering key concepts such as feature chain parsing, feature group matching, testing, versioning, and compute framework integration. This documentation is available in the `docs/docs/in_depth/` directory and is linked from the Getting Started guides.

Documentation has also been added for framework transformers, which are a key component of mloda's compute framework system. The documentation includes detailed docstrings for the relevant classes (`BaseTransformer`, `ComputeFrameworkTransformer`, and `PandasPyarrowTransformer`) and a comprehensive guide in the `docs/docs/in_depth/framework-transformers.md` file. This documentation explains how data is transformed between different compute frameworks, how to create custom transformers, and how the transformation system integrates with the rest of the mloda architecture.

The PythonDict Compute Framework has been successfully implemented as the first proposed compute framework. This framework provides a dependency-free alternative to Pandas and PyArrow, using native Python data structures (List[Dict[str, Any]]) for tabular data operations. The implementation includes complete functionality for data transformation, filtering, merging, and integration with PyArrow through transformers.

## Known Issues

* FeatureSet are created unintuitive:  
feature_set = FeatureSet()
feature_set.add(feature)

* Options.data cannot contain dictionaries as values:
  * The Feature class's __hash__ method tries to hash the options.data dictionary
  * When options.data contains a dictionary as a value, it causes "TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'"
  * Workaround: Use JSON serialization for complex data structures in options.data

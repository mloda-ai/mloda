# Requirements for SHELXL Feature Group
# 
# This feature group uses only standard Python libraries and subprocess
# to execute SHELXL and checkCIF commands. No additional Python packages
# are required beyond what's already available in the mloda framework.
#
# External dependencies (must be installed separately):
# - SHELXL: Crystallographic structure refinement program
# - checkCIF: Structure validation program (optional)
#
# These are external crystallography software packages that need to be
# installed and available in the system PATH.
